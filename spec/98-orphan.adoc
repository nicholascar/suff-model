==== Default method for approximate topological relation computation

An alternative default method to calculate the https://docs.ogc.org/is/22-047r1/22-047r1.html#sf_relations[Simple Features relations] between features whose location is uncertain and represented using elements from this model is described below. 

For a spatial feature `A` with certain position - a single geometry - and spatial feature `B` with uncertain geometry - as conveyed by this model - calculate a simple feature relation `R` as follows:

. Determine the level of measurement `B_l` for the geometries of `B`
... If `B_l` is <<Levels of Measurement, nominal>>,
.... For each geometry `BG_i` of `B`, calculate `A R BG_i` for each geometry
.... If any `A R BG_i` is `true` then `A R B` is `true`
.... Else it is `false`
... If `B_l` is <<Levels of Measurement, ordinal>>,
.... For each geometry `BG_i` of `B`, calculate `A R BG_i` for each geometry in order




.... Starting with the first geometry `BG_1` and proceeding to the last, `BG_N`, calculate `A R BG_i` for each geometry
..... If
... If `B_l` is <<Levels of Measurement, interval>>,
... If `B_l` is <<Levels of Measurement, ratio>>,
