| IRI | Preferred Label | Definition

| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/levels-of-measurement/nominal[`lom:nominal`] | nominal | The nominal level differentiates between items or subjects based only on their names or (meta-)categories and other qualitative classifications they belong to; thus dichotomous data involves the construction of classifications as well as the classification of items
| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/levels-of-measurement/ordinal[`lom:ordinal`] | ordinal | The ordinal level allows for rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted but still does not allow for a relative degree of difference between them
| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/levels-of-measurement/interval[`lom:interval`] | interval | The interval type allows for defining the degree of difference between measurements, but not the ratio between measurements
| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/levels-of-measurement/ratio[`lom:ratio`] | ratio | The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit of measurement of the same kind
